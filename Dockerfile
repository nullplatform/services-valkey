# Hand HOME to the runtime user. The RUN steps above ran as root with HOME
# already set to /home/app by the base, so tools invoked at build time left
# root-owned config and cache dirs there (tofu: ~/.terraform.d, az: ~/.azure)

# base (worker-bridge 2.0.0+) ships the app user, np on PATH and a writable
# HOME, and leaves the switch to each image. Numeric on purpose: k8s
# admission with runAsNonRoot resolves USER to a numeric id to prove it
# isn't root, and a name doesn't satisfy that check.
