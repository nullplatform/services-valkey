# CloudWatch read permission for the service metrics — granted to the AGENT
# role directly, not to the valkey permissions role.
#
# Every other action of this service (create, update, link, delete) first
# assumes the valkey permissions role created by this module. Metrics do not:
# the metrics view requests all the metrics of a cache at once, and every extra
# step per request (the np provider lookup for the role ARN, the sts
# AssumeRole call, each AWS CLI start) added seconds of latency to each graph.
# For timing reasons metrics run on the agent's own credentials and make a
# single call, cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics. That is why this policy is
# attached to agent_role_arn and additional_agent_role_arns instead of being
# part of the permissions role.
